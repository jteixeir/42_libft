## ...What do I do now?
Well, if you took around 2 months to iniciate you activities as a cadete and your job role is nothing related to coding, you are probably as lost as I was... asking "What do I do now!?
Don't be panic! There are many collegues feeling exactly like you now.

And, good news, things will be fine! Will be tough, but will be fine. :)
